# ECRYP Project
# Solovay-Strassen Primality Testing 

This repository contains the source code for the ECRYP Project by Tanvin Sharma and Abhiraj Singh for Solovay-Strassen Primality Testing Algorithm

## Preparing your environment
We have used virtual environments (venv) for its many advantages in our projects
Place the source code in a desired path in your system and enter the following commands to create the venv
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
This creates the virtual environment and to activate it,
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
Now we can go ahead by downloading all the needed requirements using pip
```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

All the required functions are in the file main.py. To test the code you can execute
```
pytest test.py
```
